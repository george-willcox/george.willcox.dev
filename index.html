                Hello there! I'm George Willcox, and I've written this website to share a small selection of the many things that I
                have created.
                I'm in my second year at the University of Cambridge, reading Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main love is programming; this is something that I spend much of my free time doing.
                I am most interested in creating graphical applications, be it games or utility software, and I enjoy experimenting
                with different concepts in the programs I write.
                This is something that has always fascinated me, I code mostly in Python, but also do work in C# and Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use Python to make games and other applications with the pygame module.
                This is as, personally, I find it more interesting as a programmer to create my games from scratch - even though it
                still is satisfying using an engine.
                I have made several applications, including a graphical calculator, a 3D raster graphics engine, a space simulator,
                a 2D physics engine, an application to render Lindenmayer systems, and many many games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please take a look in the projects tab to see some of the things I've worked on :)
            </p>
