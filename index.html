                Hello there! I'm George Willcox, this is just a place to share a small selection of the many things that I
                have created.
                I'm currently in my forth year at the University of Cambridge, reading Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main love is programming; this is something that I spend much of my free time doing.
                I am most interested in creating graphical applications, be it games or utility software, and I enjoy experimenting
                with different concepts in the programs I write.
                I code mostly in Python, but also do work in C# and Java. I've got experience using many other languages too.
                Please take a look in the projects page to see some of the things I've worked on.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My other interests include: Lego Star Wars, Magic the Gathering, bridge. kayaking, and model making. See more details on the interests page.
            </p>
