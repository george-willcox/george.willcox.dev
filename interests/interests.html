                        Quite into collecting LSW, as well as some of the other larger models from other themes.
                        The NASA sets are pretty cool, the Porsche 911 is another favourite of mine.
                        Most of my collection is Star Wars though.

                        I learned to play Magic at university as one of my friends is quite into it,
                        mostly playing commander which is quite a casual format.

                        I have two decks which I usually play with.
                        One being a heavily modified pre-constructed deck, which is now a Jhoria artifact deck.
                        And the other being an enchantments deck, with Ghen, Arcanum Weaver as the commander.

                        I've kayaked quite a bit previously, but until recently never owned my own.
                        So I bought an old one second hand and spent the summer doing it up.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Here are some pictures of before and after my work on it.
                    </p>

                    <img class="shadow" src="images/IMG_4693.PNG" width=35.5%>
                    <img class="shadow" src="images/IMG_4435.JPG" width=63% style="float: right;">
                    
                    <p>
                        In order to restore it, I first had to clean it and sand off the old paint job.
                        This proved to be more difficult than expected, especially around the rim of the cockpit where it was awkward to reach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After that, I primed and painted the boat, giving it several coats of each colour;
                        using masking tape to get a clean line between the green and the yellow.
                        After painting was finished, I sprayed the whole thing with a marine sealant.
                        Here are some pictures from along that process.
                    </p>

                        Just WW2 things really, mostly land vehicles but also some planes and boats too.
                        I'll add pictures later. The Churchill Crocodile is probably my favourite model.
