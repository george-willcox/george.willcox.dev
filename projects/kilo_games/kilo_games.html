                This was the group project I worked on in Part IB of my degree.
                We were tasked with creating an online platform to host games that would allow users to connect with bots.
                The idea being that it was aimed at people learning to code and it would give them an opportunity to create algorithms for the games we hosted.

            </p>

            <p>
                I worked on the frontend alongside one other group member, while the other 4 members created the backend.
                We did this using React.js, which was my first time using the framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was responsible for implementing the server api requests to get the game state, and the to render that on the screen.
                For connect 4, which was the first game we implemented, the approach I decided on for creating the visualisation
                was to generate the grid as an SVG and have the playing pieces as HTML elements. This made it
                relatively simple to position the elements, as I could set the position absolutely and use the same
                coordinates from the generation of the grid to make sure everything lined up correctly.
                I then used css animations to show the game pieces falling into place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then for snake, which was the second game we added, a canvas seemed to be the best choice for how to render the game state,
                as the objects are more complex than in connect 4. This is done just by drawing a rectangle for each body element of each of the snakes,
                and drawing circles to represent the eyes on their heads.
            </p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 7%;">
                <img class="shadow" src="images/chrome_J2bYxB626X.png" width=49%>
                <img class="shadow" src="images/chrome_5PSDhHqJ24.png" width=49% style="float: right">
            </div>

            <p>
                Here is a code snippet of the function which drew the eyes on the snakes:
            </p>

            <div class="highlight" data-language="js" data-functions="drawEyes,drawEye,getScaleX,getScaleY,beginPath,arc,fill,stroke"><pre>drawEyes(position, horizontal=true) {
    const drawEye = (x, y) => {
        this.ctx.beginPath();
        this.ctx.arc(x, y, 9, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
        this.ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
        this.ctx.fill();
        this.ctx.lineWidth = 4;
        this.ctx.strokeStyle = 'white';
        this.ctx.stroke();
    }
 
    if (horizontal) {
        drawEye(
            (position.x + 0.5) * this.getScaleX(),
            (position.y + 0.25) * this.getScaleY()
        );
        drawEye(
            (position.x + 0.5) * this.getScaleX(),
            (position.y + 0.75) * this.getScaleY()
        );
    } else {
        drawEye(
            (position.x + 0.25) * this.getScaleX(),
            (position.y + 0.5) * this.getScaleY()
        );
        drawEye(
            (position.x + 0.75) * this.getScaleX(),
            (position.y + 0.5) * this.getScaleY()
        );
    }
