            <h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction:</h2>

            <p>
                A Delaunay triangulation of a set of points \(P\) is a triangulation \(\text{DP}(P)\) such that no point in \(P\) lies in the circumcircle of any triangle in \(\text{DP}(P)\).
                This has the effect of maximising the minimum angle of every triangle in the triangulation, which creates a tendency to avoid thin "sliver" triangles. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This has applications in 3D graphics, as it allows a mesh to be generated from a set of points in 3D space.
                Though here I'm just using it in 2-dimensions for the sake of making a nice pattern.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="algorithm" id="algorithm"></a>Algorithm:</h2>

            <p>
                The algorithm I'm using to generate the triangulation involves incrementally adding points into the triangulation, and adjusting it to accommodate them.
            </p>

            <p>
                For each point, delete all the triangles that it is within the circumcircle of,
                then form new triangles by creating a new edge from that point to each of the vertices that were in the triangles that have been deleted.
            </p>

            <p>
                To easily determine if a point \(D\) lies inside the circumcircle of a triangle \(\bigtriangleup ABC\), you can calculate the determinant of the matrix.
                If the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are in anti-clockwise order, then the determinant will always be greater than 0.
            </p>
            <p class="math">
                \[

            <h2><a name="code" id="code"></a>About the Code:</h2>
          
            <p>
                Shown below is the function that creates the triangulation, taking an array of points and returning an array of triangles.
                It begins by creating 4 points outside of the window that are needed as a starting point for the algorithm to work,
                then each point is added into the triangulation one at a time.
                The buffer variable represents points being able to go off-screen by some amount, as this just makes the pattern look nicer by not being able to see the edges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once the triangles have been removed for a given point, the vertices in those triangles are sorted by their angle to the point being worked on.
                This makes it easy to create the new triangles for that point.
            </p>
