                This is another project that I made on commission for a client, so again all the assets were provided by them.
                It was designed to run on an raspberry pi, with buttons plugged into the GPIO pins to act as input.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can download the code here: <a href="files/token_exploder.zip" download>token_exploder.zip</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                I've added keyboard controls to this version, so that it can be played on a normal computer.
                When it says to press start, hit either the 1 or 2 key to select 1 or 2 players.
            </p>

                Most of the code for this project is contained within one file.
                I would not usually do this, separating classes into different files makes code much easier to maintain and to work on,
                but it was something that was asked of my by the client in this case.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've not done much of a write up for this one (yet), but feel free to download and have a play.
