            <p>
                This is a platformer with a maths theme for young children.
                The levels have a basic layout, and have a simple arithmetic question at the end.
                It is a project that I was commissioned to make.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="assets" id="assets"></a>Assets:</h2>

            <p>
                The game mostly just uses sprites and sounds from Super Mario Brothers. These were just what was provided by my client.
                The source code and all the used assets can be <a download href="files/maths_adventure.zip" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>.
                This includes the images, sounds, level data, and the font used.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="code" id="code"></a>About the Code:</h2>

            <p>
                This is a large project spanning many files and thousands of lines of code, so I'll not include it all here.
                You can view it in the download link if you are interested.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the work is done in the <code class="highlight inline">update</code> method of <code class="highlight inline">GameScene</code> in scenes.py.
                This makes all the necessary method calls to other classes and essentially does all that is needed for the game to run.
                It also does things like check if the player has run out of lives,
                advance the level if the player has reached the end,
                and update the HUD to display the score, lives, and coins collected.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an example, here is a snippet of code from that very class which kills the player.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight" data-functions="stop,play"><pre># Kill the player when they have no lives or fall out of the world
if self.player.lives <= 0 or self.player.rect.top > self.world_size[1]:
    # Stop all music and sounds
    pygame.mixer.music.stop()
    for sound in self.sounds.values():
        sound.stop()

    # Play death effect
    self.sounds['death'].play()
    self.dead = True  # Set dead flag
    # Causes the player to jump up in the air when dead
    self.player.velocity.y = -self.player.jump_force</pre></div>

            <h2><a name="screenshots" id="screenshots"></a>Screenshots:</h2>

            <p>
                Here are a few screenshots taken from inside the game.
            </p>
